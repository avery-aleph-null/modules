# The Purpose of Copyright

As the name implies, "copyright" is, literally, the "right to copy." Historically, the concept of copyright became important when the press was invented. Before the press was invented, content could only be copied by hand. As a result, it was easier to *limit* the availability of copies of any work.

As per the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, one primary purpose of copyright is "to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive rights to their respective writings and discoveries." [^1] However, there is much flexibility regarding the mentioned "rights."

For example, many corporations have "rights" related to who is licensed to produce merchandise related to copyrighted content. Disney, for instance, aggressively asserts its rights and stops any and all unlicensed replication of its copyrighted work. In this case, not only is Disney maximizing its profits from the royalty collected from licensed products, but it is also using copyrights to limit rivals in terms of the title of movies and other content. Because of the sheer amount of profit involved, Disney and other media corporations pour millions of dollars into the extension of the duration of copyright. [^2]

Creative Commons, on the other hand, uses the very same mechanism of copyright to encourage the sharing of content[^3].

# Copyrightability

As per the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, copyright protects "original works of authorship including literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, such as poetry, novels, movies, songs, computer software, and architecture."[^4] However, copyright does not apply to "ideas, concepts, systems, or methods of doing something", according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office[^5].
