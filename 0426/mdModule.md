# When should I get concerned?

Because Canvas runs a weighted average of all the work submitted and graded, the letter grade of the total can be inflated by lab activities and homework assignments where most people get close to perfect scores. While lab activities and homework assignments do count to the final grade, the percentage decreases as more exams are administered. It is best to evaluate the situation solely based on the score of the midterm exam and not to include lab activities and homework assignments in consideration.

The following *generally* describes people receiving the letter grades:

* "A" (3.5 to 4.0): There is not much to be concerned about at this point. Lost points tend to be due to operational errors or occasional omissions. The study skills and habits are working.
* "B" (2.5 to 3.5): In this range, there may be some conceptual misunderstanding or *not* understanding, in addition to operational errors. It is best to review the points that are lost and figure out why.
* "C" (1.5 to 2.5): This is starting to be alarming even though a "C" is, technically, a passing grade. Participants in this range may have a significant amount of misunderstanding or not understand the concepts, and/or a struggle to apply the learned knowledge. A revision of how to study and note-taking may be necessary.
* "D" (0.5 to 1.5): A "D" is not a passing grade. This range of grades often reflects difficulties in recalling knowledge in addition to difficulties in applying knowledge to solve problems. A thorough review of time budgeting, time allocation, and time management is recommended in addition to a revision of how to study and take notes in class.
* "F" (0 to 0.5): To pass the class as a whole, a grade in this range indicates an immediate need to review time budgeting and time management. Because of how the course topics "stack up" in terms of dependency, an immediate intervention is needed to strengthen the foundation that is needed for future topics. At the least, tutoring is suggested. A conversation with the professor is highly suggested to find out how to proceed.

# A quick recap of time budgeting

Time budgeting is part of the logistics (along with food, sleep, etc.) of doing well at school. Each hour of in-lecture time should be accompanied by two hours of study activities outside of class. These two hours can be utilized for the following:

* Reading ahead of the lecture,
* Reviewing material from past lectures,
* Doing homework, or redoing past labs,
* REvising notes taken in class, filling in gaps.

For example, if a typical class meets twice each week, each lecture lasts 80 minutes, then there are $80 \times 2 = 160$ minutes of in-lecture time. The suggested amount of time to spend out-of-lecture is, therefore $160 \times 2 = 320$ minutes *per week*. This is $5 \frac{1}{3}$ hours per week.

# Time allocation and management

With a sufficient time budget, the next task is to allocate and manage the time. Due to the Monday-Wednesday or Tuesday-Thursday schedule, there are 4 days between lectures over the weekend. It is particularly important to allocate time during the weekend to study to "keep the momentum going."

The duration of each study session can vary. For complex concepts, it is best to have a short session to read some material, and then let the subconscious digest it for a while. Then followed by a longer block of time to concentrate on the concepts and write notes to capture the understanding.

It can be helpful, especially to those with ADHD, to arrange a structure around studying. This structure can involve time, day of the week, location, and even fellow students.

# Note taking

Some groups of concepts are complex because of the vast interconnection between individual concepts. The short-term memory of a person is about 7 for familiar concepts, and as low as 4 for new and complex information. Short-term memory also only lasts about 20 seconds, and it can be easily interfered with and "lost."

Consequently, taking notes and writing down the concepts being studied is critical to the understanding of a group of complex concepts. 

Note-taking is not only helpful during a lecture to record an individual's own understanding of the material, but it is also helpful while reading materials before or after a lecture. Even though some material is *already written*, the point of taking notes is at least two-folded. First, while writing notes, a learner can choose to present the material in his/her own way, and not organized as in the original reading material. Second, the notes taken can be more concise and therefore easier to read in the future.

Interestingly, the *process* of taking notes also helps to build more pathways in the neocortex between concepts. This improved familiarity is key to efficient problem-solving using one's knowledge.
