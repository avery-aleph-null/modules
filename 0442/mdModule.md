title: "Module 0442: Performance Review Standards"
---

This document is intended for faculty who are going through performance reviews. 

[Article 8](https://www.lrcft.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Article-8-Performance-Review.pdf) of the LRCFT contract is dedicated to performance review, and it should be read carefully in its entirety to understand the process as well as the rights of the faculty member being evaluated. Section 8.4 is particularly important because it outlines the standards. 

As per [Article 11](https://www.lrcft.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Article-11-Professional-Expectations-and-Development-Opportunities.pdf) of the LRCFT contract, section 11.2 describes the **professional expectations**. 

The actual [classroom faculty performance review form](https://employees.losrios.edu/lrccd/employee/doc/hr/performance-reviews/faculty-classroom.pdf) can be downloaded so that the faculty member being evaluated knows the evaluation rubric ahead of time. In addition, the [student review of faculty form](https://employees.losrios.edu/lrccd/employee/doc/hr/performance-reviews/p-sr1.docx) is also available to understand the perspective of students in the context of the evaluation process.

For more information and guidance from the union, please go to the [LRCFT Resources](https://www.lrcft.org/resources-faculty/) and look under the sections of "performance review trainings", "equity reflection trainings" and "self study training."
