{% include syllabus.md courseCode="10820" courseTitle="CISP 300: Algorithm Design/Problem Solving" courseDescription="This course introduces methods for solving typical computer problems through algorithm design. Topics include assessing and analyzing computer problems in a top-down, divide-and-conquer approach that leads to a programming solution. It also covers programming plans and detailed design documents from which source code versions of programs are created." courseSLO="* define operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.\n* differentiate control structures, including branches (conditional statements) and loops (pre-checking and post-checking loops).\n* deduce post-condition from pre-condition for control structures, including assignment statements, branches, and loops.\n* construct a trace table to emulate the execution of a program that utilizes variables, various control structures, data organizations, subroutines, and parameters.\n* contrast the lifespan limits and behaviors of local variables, by-value parameters, and by-reference parameters.\n* compare the two methods of passing results: by-reference parameters and return value.\n* compare in-line copy-and-paste coding with structured subroutines in terms of maintainability, defect containment, testability, and other metrics.\n* create a subroutine to abstract one or more similar blocks of in-line code using local variables, parameters, and return values.\n* differentiate roles involved in software development, including developers, analysts, and test engineers.\n" %}
