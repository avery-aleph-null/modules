# More details

## CTEA

As a result of this act, the copyright term was extended to the life of the creator plus 70 years[^1]. Lawrence Lessig considered this unconstitutional. 

## Creative Commons

A non-profit organization founded by Lawrence Lessig and Eric Eldred in 2001. Originally, the organization aimed to counter and resist the conventional restrictive copyright practice. However, the organization eventually found a way to use existing copyright laws to promote the free sharing of content. 

## Creative Commons License

While there are many variations of the Creative Commons License, the essence is the permission for others to share, use, and modify. In this sense, the Creative Common licenses are similar to open-source licenses. Creative Common licenses may have one or more of the following attributes:

* ‚äúND: no derivation
* üÑçCC0: no right reserved
* üÑéSA: share alike (infectious license)
* üÑèNC: Non-Commercial
* üÖÆ: public domain
* üÖØBY: Attribution.

There are seven combinations[^4] of these attributes.

# Getting involved

## Using Creative Commons licenses

For people who want to share their creations, using Creative Commons licenses helps to improve the visibility of Creative Commons. This serves two important purposes. First, more people who want to share their creations become aware of Creative Commons. Second, the shared content is legally treated as the content creator desires.

## Financially supporting Creative Commons

As with most non-profit organizations, Creative Commons benefits from [financial contributions](https://creativecommons.org/support-cc/) from individuals and organizations.

## Advocate and Network

[Creative Commons Global Network](https://network.creativecommons.org/) is a digital global community of individuals who work together to continue the share and remix culture, as well as the basic principles behind Creative Commons licenses.
