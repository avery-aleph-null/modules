# Why?

When we learn from a lecture, a book, or a video, there is an illusion of grasping the material. At the moment of reading, watching, or conversing, the learner may feel everything is connected and hence understood. However, this is an illusion because the short-term memory is elusive and limited.

When learning content that is challenging, the short-term memory can store about 4 items for up to 30 seconds. During these 30 seconds, the mind may connect the new material to past material already learned. Without reinforcement, however, there may not be much retention of the new material and its connection to past material.

Notetaking can help in two ways. 

First, the *process* of taking notes improves the ability of the mind to retain and convert short-term memory into longer-term memory. This is accomplished by presenting the learned material in written form, therefore exercising additional neural pathways that are different from the pathways of listening, reading, or watching.

Second and more importantly, the *outcome* of taking notes is a more permanent form of the material that can be reviewed at a later point. 

# The medium

The medium of notes can vary. However, the most basic paper and pencil work exceptionally well. Consider using [a template](blank.pdf) instead of just lined binder paper.

## Sections

The linked template has a few sections.

* Pre-lecture
* In-lecture
* Post-lecture

The term "lecture" can be replaced by any learning experience that is in real-time and cannot be conveniently paused. Let's examine what to do with each section.

### Pre-lecture

The pre-lecture part is optional, but filling it in is recommended. This section captures the following items:

* Reminders of what questions should be addressed in the lecture,
* Past material that is the prerequisite of the lecture,
* Summary of reading the material that will be covered in the lecture.

There is no rule of when this section should be filled. 

### In-lecture

This section is the bulk of notetaking. This section has several purposes:

* Capture a condensed version of the lecture material. This is particularly important if the lecture is not recorded. Use shorthand instead of full sentences whenever possible. As long as the person who will be reading this understands the material, it is fine! Capturing parts of the lecture is helpful for review purposes, but jotting down notes is also a way to stay focused and engaged in a lecture. 
* Capture questions. In many situations, questions cannot be asked during a lecture. Therefore, it is important to record these questions to be reviewed, and hopefully answered, after a lecture.
* Personal *Eureka!* moments. A lecture may not mention some implicit connections with past material. Personal discoveries during a lecture, call them *Eureka!* moments, or epiphanies, do not last long in one's mind. Write it down, and put a star next to it!
* Capture the expectations of a lecture. What do I think I will be learning? What questions may be answered? 

Because the in-lecture section has to serve multiple purposes and record material from different sources (the presentation and the thoughts of the notetaker), it is bound to be **messy**!  This is why we need the [post-lecture](#post-lecture) section.

### Post-lecture

This section is also optional, but it is very important.

As mentioned earlier the [in-lecture](#in-lsecture) section is likely to be a mess. It is entirely possible that the bulk of it may not be very valuable. If the notes will serve a purpose later, it is helpful to clean up and organize the messy in-lecture section.

The post-lecture section should be filled not too long after a lecture. This is especially true for college students taking a few classes. A lecture often has the effect of "flushing out" a previous lecture in the learner's mind. 

In the process of writing post-lecture notes, the pre-lecture and in-lecture sections can be reviewed. Are all the questions answered? If not, act on these unanswered questions! 

Are there important definitions or terms introduced? If so, copy them to the post-lecture section.

Expand on the short notes on *Eureka~* moments. While an epiphany is, by itself, important, the intuitive connection can often benefit from deliberate, analytical, logical, and deeper processing.

## Organization

Even on paper, some fields help organize notes. The organization is important because it improves the effectiveness of information retrieval.

* Dates. The dates of each section serve several purposes. First, this makes it easier to chronologically organize the material. Second, for certain individuals, being able to see the dates also helps to induce a sense of accomplishment.
* Page numbers. This is important to cross-reference in notes. Cross-referencing is difficult during a lecture, but it can be very helpful in the preparation of the pre-lecture and post-lecture sections. A pre-lecture section may reference prerequisite material for a lecture. A post-lecture section may reference past material that connects to the new material.
* Single-sided. While this may seem like a very minor point, it is important. This allows laying out many pages of notes on a large surface to cross-reference and make connections between the pages and different lectures.
* Binder-ready. Use a hole-puncher so that the individual sheets of paper can be organized in a binder. A binder (as opposed to a folder) is an excellent organization tool because it reduces the chances of losing loose pages of notes. A binder also allows the *insertion* of notes and other material.
