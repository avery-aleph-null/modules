# Why?

When we learn from a lecture, a book, or a video, there is an illusion of grasping the material. At the moment of reading, watching, or conversing, the learner may feel everything is connected and hence understood. However, this is an illusion because the short-term memory is elusive and limited.

When learning content that is challenging, the short-term memory can store about 4 items for up to 30 seconds. During these 30 seconds, the mind may connect the new material to past material already learned. Without reinforcement, however, there may not be much retention of the new material and its connection to past material.

Notetaking can help in two ways. 

First, the *process* of taking notes improves the ability of the mind to retain and convert short-term memory into longer-term memory. This is accomplished by presenting the learned material in written form, therefore exercising additional neural pathways that are different from the pathways of listening, reading, or watching.

Second and more importantly, the *outcome* of taking notes is a more permanent form of the material that can be reviewed at a later point. 

# The medium

The medium of notes can vary. However, the most basic paper and pencil works exceptionally well.
