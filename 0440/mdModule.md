title: "Module 0440: Syntax and the Syntax to Describe Syntax"
---

# Context

* What is this?
  * This module describes what syntax means, and the syntax used to describe syntax.
* Why is this important?
  * On the path to learning how to program, understanding and applying the syntax of a programming language is important. Instead of using a "loose" pseudocode syntax, it is more efficient to "learn the real thing" from the get-go!
* How is this done?
  * This is accomplished by using a *meta* syntax language.
