# Student-Centricity

What does it mean to be student-centric? This is a question about the scope of the role of a faculty member.

## Temporal Scope

Is this focus short-term, just for the class session? Or, is the focus long-term, extending to include transferring and/or career?

## Student Classification Scope

Is this focus on the student as an individual, or is this focus on the categories in which the student can be classified?
