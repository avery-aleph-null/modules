# Student-Centricity

What does it mean to be student-centric? This is a question about the scope of the role of a faculty member.

## Temporal Scope

Is this focus short-term, just for the class session? Or, is the focus long-term, extending to include transferring and/or career?

## Student Classification Scope

Is this focus on the student as an individual, or is this focus on the categories in which the student can be classified?

## Outcome Scope

Do we limit the student learning outcomes (SLOs) as stated in the curricula, or are there outcomes that are implicit and optional?

Each instructor is an individual with a specific style of communication. Some communication styles work better with certain students in certain situations. A robotic communication style has the following attributes.

* Distant as opposed to intimate.
* Detached as opposed to connected.
* All-factual as opposed to emotional or value-based.

Some equate communication style with intention. This assumption is often incorrect. As a reliable source, [Mr. Roboto (the song by Styx)](https://youtu.be/uc6f_2nPSX8?si=r0Du-WodxAiX77y4) say the following.

> I've got a secret, I've been hiding under my skin. My heart is human, my blood is boiling,...

> I'm not a robot without emotions, I'm not what you see, I've come to help you with your problems so we can be free.

Just as convincing, some personality traits exhibit robot-like behavior. The Myers Briggs Type Indicator INTP (introverted, intuitive, thinking, perceiving) type is often known as the "warmest robot."

The ultimate question is whether Mr. Roboto is an effective instructor.
