# Just including and sharing

It is not uncommon to include content that is licensed by one of the Creative Common licenses. For example, the following photograph conveys a sense of sharing better than words.

<div markdown="1">
![Boys sharing a book](https://live.staticflickr.com/4343/36111195234_a6db56c0a9_b.jpg)
["Ta-Oy boys share a book"](https://www.flickr.com/photos/127744844@N06/36111195234) by [US Department of State](https://www.flickr.com/photos/127744844@N06) is licensed under [CC BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/?ref=openverse).
</div>

In this case, it is important to include the attribution because of the "BY" part of the Creative Commons (CC) license. Even if some work does not include the "BY" for attribution, it is *always* a good idea to include attribution!

The only restriction in this case is that NC (NonCommerical) content should not be included in for-profit content.

# Derivation

Let's say that I want to make an inside joke about "NoDerivative". I may start with a Creative Commons Licensed image like the following:

<div markdown="1">
![Picture of derivative](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Acceleration_as_derivative_of_velocity_along_trajectory.svg)
<p class="attribution">"<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=36419077">Acceleration as derivative of velocity along trajectory</a>" by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Fred_the_Oyster">Fred the Oyster</a> is licensed under <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=openverse">CC BY-SA 4.0 <img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-right: 0.125em; display: inline;" /><img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-right: 0.125em; display: inline;" /><img src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/sa.svg" style="height: 1em; margin-right: 0.125em; display: inline;" /></a>.</p>
</div>

First, I need to assess whether a derivation or adaptation is allowed. Because my content is licensed as CC BY-NC-SA, it is more restrictive than the picture from which I plan to derive. As a result, this conflicts with the SA (ShareAlike) part of the license of the original work. 

In general, the rules of whether a CC licensed work can be adapted, remixed, or derived from are as follows:

* If the original work is CC PD: the derived work can be licensed in any CC license.
* If the original work is CC BY: the derived work can be licensed in any CC license except CC PD.
* If the original work is CC NC: the derived work can be licensed in any CC license with NC in it.
* If the original work includes ND: no derived work can be published.
* If the original work includes SA: the derived work must be licensed **exactly** as the original work.
