# Just sharing

It is not uncommon to include content that is licensed by one of the Creative Common licenses. For example, the following photograph conveys a sense of sharing better than words.

<div markdown="true">

["Ta-Oy boys share a book"](https://www.flickr.com/photos/127744844@N06/36111195234) by [US Department of State](https://www.flickr.com/photos/127744844@N06) is licensed under [CC BY-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/?ref=openverse).

In this case, it is important to include the attribution because of the "BY" part of the Creative Commons (CC) license. Even if some work does not include the "BY" for attribution, it is *always* a good idea to include attribution!
