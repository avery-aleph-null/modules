title: "Module 0438: CIS sections offering and full-time schedule sign up (proposed)"
---

# What does the union have to say?

The LRCFT contract does not specify how scheduling should be done! The contract does specify that the dean of a division has the right of assignment. 

# Section offering

There are a few factors that determine how sections of courses are offered (without consideration of modality and actual schedule):

* Program needs. For every program in the catalog, a student should be able to complete it in 2 years (4 semesters). Course offerings must at least enable the completion of any program in two years.
* Published program pathways. It is beneficial to match actual course offerings to match published program pathways.

In terms of modality and schedule (days of week and time slot), there are many additional factors to consider:

* Student population: students who work during the day instead of full-time students who do not work full-time.
* Specific classroom/lab requirements.
* Prerequisite/corequisite requirements. Courses along a prerequisite chain can potentially be scheduled at the slot (days-of-week and time slot).
* Competition from sister colleges.
* Subject matter complexity.

To a certain extent, the scheduling of sections can be adjusted to meet the time constraints of faculty members. 

# Section request/assignment

## Criteria

There are some key criteria from the assignment (who teaches what) perspective:

* Experience and effectiveness from the perspective of students.
* Cross-training back-up instructors.
* Workload due to new preps.
* Instructor personal time constraints: pick-up and drop-off of children, etc.

## The politics

Fully disclosing and examining the politics of section assignments is healthy, practical, and necessary in this discussion. 

* Senior colleagues (long-timers):
  * Closer to retirement, may not want to invest energy into new preps because of the limited reuse value of the preps.
  * May have invested years, even decades of energy to perfect how to teach certain courses.
    * By extension, may be the most effective instructors to teach certain courses.
  * Used to the by-seniority method.
    * Have endured the experience of the by-seniority method as junior colleagues for years, finally getting to "reap the benefits" of being a senior member of the department.
* Mid-journey colleagues:
  * Have started to invest energy and effort to specialize in certain courses.
  * May have older children, but still need time to transport children to/from school.
  * May benefit from having back-up instructors and use the release time to develop new courses or attend conferences and training.
  * Still enduring the experience of the by-seniority method, but starting to reap some of the benefits of this method.
* Junior colleagues:
  * May have younger children and the needs associated with parents of younger children.
  * Many courses are new preps that require energy and effort.
  * May be experimenting with different ways to teach courses.
  * Experience the full effect of the by-seniority method.

If there are additional factors that are neglected, please help update this document so that this section is more complete.

*Assuming* that the main factors are accounted for, some questions may help each colleague evaluate the proposed method. There is no right or wrong answer because value is individual.

* If the by-seniority method was considered unfair when one was junior, then is it fair to perpetuate the same method to the current junior colleagues?
  * In other words, is the meaning of fairness relative to one's seniority instead of absolute, regardless of one's current seniority status?
* Junior colleagues will, one day, become senior members of the department. Will what is fair to a junior member continue to be fair as the junior member gains seniority?
* As the more senior faculty members retire, what is the plan to transition specialized courses to newer faculty members?
* If a faculty member cannot teach a course due to unforeseeable events, what is the backup plan?
  * It is prudent to have at least two faculty members who are ready to teach a course from the perspective of being able to offer specialized courses like CISP 310 each semester. However, as a specialized course, it can be challenging as a new prep without the "old hand" providing support.

Trying to step into a colleague's shoes helps to expand one's perspective on this matter. Having an open-minded face-to-face discussion is even better!

## Proposed scheduling process

Terms:

* Rotating priority: this is a mechanism in which each faculty member is assigned a priority (0 means the highest) each semester to determine the order of section (course offering) requests. The algorithm is described [later](#rotating-priority-algorithm).
* Individual preference (list): each faculty member can specify their preferences for each course. More details on this [later](#individual-preference).
* Course preference list: a list of all the courses in which each item is the summary of the individual preferences of all faculty members for that course.

The following proposed process is flexible. The process includes a rotating priority mechanism for courses by default. The rotating priority ensures an *opportunity* for every member to request teaching assignments.

However, the proposed process also includes a mechanism for members to close a course from rotating priority. The scope of the closure is variable. Modality and scheduling details add specificality. These additional constraints must be added if the course has multiple offerings in each semester.

A course (or specific sections thereof) that is (are) closed to rotating priority cannot be requested by members who are not on a mutually agreed list. This simply means the course cannot be requested strictly based on the rotating priorities. Members can negotiate on a per-semester basis and trade teaching assignments.

This process also offers a third option. A course can be on the individual preference list of at least one member, but it is not closed to rotating priorities. This announces that the course is preferred by at least one member, but otherwise is available to the rotating priorities process for others to request it *without* negotiation. Before requesting a course, it is collegial to contact those who express a preference, but still open the course to rotating priorities.

### Individual preference

To facilitate better communication and potential collaboration, each full-time faculty member has the option to provide an individual preference list that captures the following information:

* Courses that this individual prefers to teach, for each course, fill in the following:
  * Preference level so that all listed courses are ordered. (0 is the highest priority)
  * Modality and schedule (optional for specifically):
    * online (specify synchronous or asynchronous), in-person, or hybrid
    * if it is not fully online and asynchronous, time slots
  * An optional description/comment.
  * Will this individual make this course open to "strictly by rotating priority" scheduling?
    * If yes, will this individual share the course material with other faculty members?
    * If no, 
      * Will this individual entertain negotiations for someone else to teach this course? Answering yes here does not imply an agreement, just a willingness to discuss and negotiate 

 As an example, (this is *just* an example!):

---
* CISP 310
  * Priority: 0
  * Modality and schedule: no restrictions
  * Comment: I have developed a custom processor and the associated tools to teach this course. This took years of continual refinement and the addition of features.
  * Open to rotating priority?
    * Yes
      * Willing to share existing course material?
        * Yes
* CISP 440
  * Priority: 1
  * Modality and schedule: In person, Spring, MW 3pm to 4:30pm
  * Comment: This is a fun class to teach, I enjoy teaching the theoretical and math side of computer science.
  * Open to rotating priority?
    * No
      * Willing to entertain negotiation?
        * Yes

---

There is no limit to how many courses can be on this individual preference, but the listed courses (and sections thereof) should be *regularly* taught by the individual, and the individual must be willing to help update the curriculum of the listed courses.  

"Regularly" in this context means a high percentage of teaching a course/section whenever the course is offered. In the case of a new faculty member (on tenure track), "regularly" may not be applicable, the qualification can then be based on what courses the individual was hired to teach.

In the case that a course is on one single individual preference, the individual must be responsible for the maintenance and updates of the curriculum.

These lists will be compiled and published to the whole department. The purpose of these lists is to make it clear to all colleagues the preferences of each individual. Courses that do not appear on anyone's list are, by default, open to rotating priority.

There is a *possibility* that the initial individual preference lists may have conflicts where at least two faculty members list the same course, and at least one does not open the course to rotating priority. Note that a conflict involves overlapping modalities and possibly scheduling constraints. If there is no such overlap, then there is no conflict to resolve.

In this situation, the *preferred* method is for the affected faculty members to work it out. The course may be shared by the individuals with an alternating schedule while remaining closed to rotating priority. If the individuals cannot come to a resolution, then the dean is the only person with the authority to determine the scheduling of the course.

The individual preferences can be updated. When a course curriculum is developed, the developer is the only person who can specify the new course in his/her individual preference list. 

### Course preference list

From the individual preferences, a course preference list is prepared to show the following for each course:

* Course code
  * Whose individual preference list(s) do(es) this course code appear on?
  * Is this course open to rotating priority?
    * If no, and it appears on more than one individual preference list, how is scheduling arranged?

The following is an example:

---
* CISP 440
  * Tak and Kahkashan
  * No
    * Tak teaches in Spring semesters, Kahkashan in Fall semesters, mutually agreed upon

---

The purpose of the course preference list is to facilitate an automated method to schedule classes, taking individual preferences and rotating priority into consideration. It also provides a quick way for any colleague who wants to take on a new prep to check whether someone else may be impacted (listed but open to rotating priority) or may need a personal negotiation (closed to rotating priority). 

### Rotating priority algorithm

A somewhat random and fair way to change priority per semester is to serialize all possible permutations, and then use a large prime number to step through the generated results. This can be done using a script like the following:

```javascript
"use strict";
module.paths.unshift('/usr/local/lib/node_modules')
const combinatorics = require('/usr/local/lib/node_modules/js-combinatorics/commonjs/combinatorics.js')

let x = [...(new combinatorics.Permutation([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))]
console.log(x.length)
const p = 1000861
for (let i = 0, j=p; i < 20; ++i)
{
  console.log(x[j].join(','))
  j = (j + p) % 3628800
}
```

The output of this script is as follows:

```text
2,7,8,5,0,4,6,1,9,3
5,4,7,1,2,0,3,8,6,9
8,2,4,7,1,5,6,3,9,0
1,0,4,5,6,2,3,9,7,8
3,8,0,9,4,5,6,7,2,1
6,4,9,3,5,0,2,1,7,8
9,2,7,0,5,4,8,1,6,3
2,0,6,7,8,1,4,5,3,9
4,8,3,1,7,5,9,2,6,0
7,5,1,8,9,0,3,6,2,4
0,4,1,5,9,6,8,7,3,2
3,0,9,1,2,4,7,5,6,8
5,8,6,4,0,7,1,2,9,3
8,5,4,1,2,0,7,6,3,9
1,4,3,8,2,7,0,6,9,5
4,1,2,5,6,0,8,9,3,7
6,8,9,7,2,4,0,5,3,1
9,5,7,3,4,0,8,1,2,6
2,4,7,0,6,8,3,1,9,5
5,1,4,7,8,0,9,3,2,6
```

Each faculty member can be assigned a particular position in a list, and each list is for one semester. As a result, this quoted list is enough for about 6 years because there are three chances to sign up for classes per academic year (Fall, Spring and Summer). The complete list has 10 factorial permutations, and the use of a large prime number ensures a fair rotation of all permutations.

### Request iterations

For the Fall and Spring semesters, each semester has 3 iterations of requesting sections after courses that are closed to rotating priority are assigned based on the individual preference lists and the course list.

First, courses that are closed to rotating priority are assigned according to the individual preferences and the course preference list. Exceptions can be made on a per-semester basis. A process may be used to confirm the preferences and allow per-semester alterations.

In the **first** iteration, the priority determines the order in which each faculty member can sign up for up to 0.5 FTE. This means the total FTE request in this iteration cannot exceed an entire section beyond 0.5 FTE. A faculty member who has at least 0.5 FTE of load that is closed to rotating priority does not participate in this iteration.

In the **second** iteration, the same priority determines the order in which each faculty member can sign up for up to 1.0 FTE. Again, this means the total FTE request of the first and the second iterations combined cannot exceed an entire section beyond 1.0 FTE. A faculty member who has at least 1 FTE of load that is closed to rotating priority does not participate in this iteration.

The **third** iteration is for overload. Faculty members are offered an opportunity in the same priority assignment to request overload FTEs. Combining the first, second, and third iterations, the total FTE requested cannot exceed 1.4 FTE. 

In each iteration, timing is crucial. As soon as an individual submits priority-based requests, the schedule is open to the person with the immediately lower priority. The system times out and moves on to the next person if no requests are made within the allotted amount of time.
