# _Module 0420: Symbols, Definitions, Rigor, and Precision_

# Potential challenges of a STEM class

In almost every STEM subject, there is an extensive use of precise symbols and rigorous application of definitions. By comparison, human-human interaction is often fuzzy, flexible, verbose, and ambiguous.

Students who have started studying STEM early on are already used to working with precise symbols and rigorous use of definitions and reasoning. However, for students who first encounter a STEM college-level subject, especially one that is at the transfer level, these common elements of STEM subjects can present a challenge.

# Symbols and Definitions

A symbol is a concise and yet precise way to represent a concept. For example, the digit 0 represents "zero", "none", "nada", etc. But in some contexts, it can also represent "false". Yet in some other contexts, it simply represents "the identity of addition." As a result, it is important to establish the *context* in which a symbol is defined. In this example, "0" represents different concepts in algebra, *boolean* algebra, and *abstract* algebra.

What is conciseness? It means "no simpler way to denote" something. What about precision? It means "no two ways to interpret" something. *Both* are important in the use of symbols and names in any STEM subject.

What a symbol represents is seldom construed out of thin air. Symbols relate to each other by definitions. If the knowledge of a STEM subject is a fabric, then symbols are buttons on the fabric, and definitions are the mesh of threads that connect the buttons. 

For example, the commutative axiom of algebra (as well as boolean algebra and abstract algebra!) has a definition of

$$x+y = y+x$$

This definition makes use of $x$ and $y$ as symbols of variables, $+$ as the symbol of addition, and $=$ as the symbol of equality.

## Spotting definitions

In studying a STEM topic, the first step is to spot definitions that involve symbols. For example, in physics, a statement may say "Let $v$ be the velocity." This definition is crucial to understanding other definitions in the same context. 

In more complex STEM subjects, there may be many symbols in a context. The human mind can track about 5 to 7 items in short-term memory. Until the definitions of symbols are fully understood and become a part of long-term memory, it can be challenging to keep track of many new symbols that are all being introduced at the same time.

## Note-taking while reading

This is where note-taking becomes important. Some authors [compare note-taking to developing a second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/resources). Note-taking is a mechanism to expand the capacity of short-term memory.

In the study of a complex STEM topic, a list of symbols and their definitions and meanings can be very helpful. Just the creation of the list is a form of studying. Reading, writing, listening, and speaking all involve different neural pathways. The more neural pathways are involved, the more likely we are to remember, to recall, and to apply something that we learn. This is also why handwriting is considered better than typing for people who are tactile sensitive.

Does a list from the text do the same? Can't the professor provide a list of definitions?

The effect of reading, spotting definitions, and developing a list *as a process* is different from that of reading a prepared list. This is because the former is an active process, and the latter is more passive.

## Reading ahead and lectures

Ideally, it is best to read the material to be learned and integrate note-taking into the reading process. This involves reading and writing as two pathways to connect concepts. 

A face-to-face lecture is an opportunity to engage the other two pathways in the learning process: listening and talking. Any questions in the notes from reading can be asked in class. The *formulation* of a meaningful question involves a significant amount of thought. Formulating a question exercises the representation of a concept in one's mind and how to connect that to the notations and words. The benefits of asking questions are not limited to asking professors questions in a lecture, but also among peers.

A student who reads ahead and understands everything can still benefit from a lecture. A *confirmation* of one's understanding is also important because it reinforces the neural pathways involved in the understanding of concepts. Depending on the individual, this confirmation can also trigger the brain's reward system, which makes learning "fun."

The converse is someone who did not read ahead before a lecture. The sensation of being overwhelmed by the number of symbols and definitions can trigger anxiety. Anxiety itself triggers the brain to prepare for fight-or-flight. That preparation involves brain chemistry that reduces cognitive capacity. Some individuals may simply "feel bad," but others can spiral into panic. In panic mode, essentially all cognitive capability is suppressed. Repeated episodes can quickly cause a long-term spiral that affects academic performance and mental health.

## Note-taking while reading ahead takes time

Yes. Depending on the individual, it can be a *significant* amount of time. 

[Time budgeting, management, and prioritization](../0417/mdModule.html) are all crucial in the learning process. This module focuses on *how* to use the resource (time), read the linked module on how to plan to make sure the resource is available and used efficiently.
