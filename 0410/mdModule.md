title: "Module 0410: Start of Semester Check-list for CIS instructors"
---

# What is this?

This document is mostly intended for new faculty members as a preparation roadmap at the beginning of the first semester. However, veteran instructors are more than welcome to read this and contribute changes!

# Deliverables

This section outlines what must be ready in the first week of class.

## Syllabus

### Syllabus content

In the context of a class, a syllabus serves multiple purposes:

* An outline of topics,
* Class related policies.

In a sense, it is a contract between the instructor and students. Let's get into some of the required sections of a syllabus:

* Course description: this section includes the course code (such as CISP 310), the course title, the course description, unit count, and course student learning outcomes (SLOs).
* Section description: a section is an offering of a course. This part includes the modality, meeting days/time, meeting location, and start/end dates of the session.
* Instructor information: This section includes information needed for students to find the instructor: name, email, office hour time and location, and other means to contact.
* Communication policy: this section describes expectations related to communication, including, but not limited to, the following:
  * Expected frequency for students to check their email/messages from the learning management system (LMS). Every 24 hours for weekdays and 48 hours for weekends are reasonable expectations.
  * Turn-around time: this is the maximum amount of time that the instructor may take to respond to a student's electronic message. 24 hours for weekdays and 48 hours for weekends are reasonable for in-person sections.
  * Office hours: this describes how to utilize office hours, especially if office hours are held online via Zoom.
* Course material/resources: this section outlines what materials/resources are needed.  Textbook, YouTube channel, etc. go to this section.
* Accommodations: This section describes how a student can get accommodation from the [Disability Services and Programs for Students](https://arc.losrios.edu/dsps). Accommodations can vary for individuals.
* Student conduct: this section describes conduct expectations. The college has its own [student conduct document](https://arc.losrios.edu/student-resources/office-of-student-conduct/student-standards-of-conduct-guide). Each instructor can include additional items as long as these items do not conflict with college policies.
  * Academic integrity/cheating: this section may be needed to clarify the expectations. It is best to define cheating in the broadest sense, such as "cheating in the context of a class refers to deception that relates to assessments or classroom management."
  * Examples of what constitutes cheating can be helpful. For example, if a student is absent, but another student signs the roll sheet, does that constitute cheating?
  * Consequences of cheating: this states what the instructor will do in response to cheating. Due to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ([FERPA](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html)), instructors cannot share details of cases of cheating. As a result, it is important to rely on a college-wide system to track occurrences of cheating. Use the [Violation of Student Conduct Referral Form](https://studentconduct.arc.losrios.edu/) to report instances of cheating.
  * Before filing a referral, it is best to check with [the Office of Student Conduct](https://arc.losrios.edu/student-resources/office-of-student-conduct) to understand the process.
* Late policy: this section describes what happens when work is submitted late.
* Absence policy: this section describes what an absence is, and what happens when there are too many absences. This section can also describe how absence excuses are evaluated.
  * The enforcement of absence policy is important so that legitimate wait-listed students can enroll in classes.
  * The enforcement of absence policy can also help curb fraudulent enrollment.
  * [Regulation 2222](https://losrios.edu/shared/doc/board/regulations/R-2222.pdf) of the Los Rios Community College District includes absence-related policies.
  * This regulation was written prior to online teaching. As a result, the term "session of a class" is ambiguous for 100% asynchronous online classes.
    * A class session, for the purposes of absences, can be defined as a scheduled activity that has a published due date.
    * At the beginning of a semester, an activity may be a quiz based on the syllabus.
  * It is helpful to identify students absent by the first Wednesday of a semester to curb fraudulent enrollment.
* Assessment and grading: this section outlines the categories of assessments and how the final letter grade is computed from the numerical scores.
* Topic schedule: this section outlines the topics and when each subject will be introduced. A list of suggested topics and their durations is in the course curriculum. Sign in to [the Los Rios Intranet](https://inside.losrios.edu/~intranet/cgi-bin/intra/services.cgi), then select "SOCRATES Curriculum Services", then "Courses", then the discipline, then the individual course.

A copy of the syllabus of each class should be submitted to the division office no later than the first class meeting. For 100% asynchronous online classes, the syllabus should be submitted prior to the first day of the semester session (full semester, 8W1, 8W2, 5W1, etc.). Please follow division-specific instructions to submit syllabi.

### Organizing syllabi

Instructors who teach multiple sections can benefit from a more structured approach to organizing syllabi. Common portions of syllabi can be maintained as their documents and a master template document acts as the template to structure the components. The template can also factor in syllabus sections specific to each section.

## Canvas shells (one for each section)

Even for in-person classes, the [LRCFT contract](https://www.lrcft.org/what-we-do/contract/) section 11.2.5 specifies that online LMS course shells should be maintained. Please refer to the contract for a full description of the minimum usage of the LMS.

# Using Canvas

As an LMS, Canvas offers a variety of features. This section explores some of the main configuration options and features.

## Concepts

### Activities

* Quiz: a quiz consists of one or more questions, and each question can be of a variety of types. Depending on question types, grading can be automatic or manual.
* Assignment: an assignment has an associated due date and a score. There are options for how work is submitted. Grading is manual.
* Discussion: a discussion is an activity that may, or may not be, graded. This is a method for the class to communicate asynchronously.

### Content

* File: an instructor can upload a file as content.
* Page: an instructor can utilize the web-based editor of Canvas to create a web page in Canvas. Note that not all HTML features are supported on a Canvas page.
* External URL: an instructor can create a link (URL) to any resource on the Internet.
* Announcements: an announcement is a specific message that is broadcast to all students.

### Organization

Canvas offers two main organization methods. Click "Home" of a course, then click "Choose Home Page." This provides a few options as the landing page of a course. The most common method is to use "Course Modules" as the landing page. 

### Mastery

The organization of course modules is flexible. A module is the only level of containment in a Canvas course. Within a module, activities and contents can be included and ordered.

Each activity (assignment or quiz) optionally has a mastery path. A mastery path is specified by thresholds in points and the next activity to unlock based on the score.

### Outcomes and Rubrics

Canvas allows the tracking of (learning) outcomes. Outcomes can be hierarchically organized. This is an optional and complex feature to use in a Canvas shell.

The top-level outcome groups should match the student learning outcomes (SLOs) that are included in the curriculum of a course. Sub-levels can be used to increase the granularity of an SLO.

An objective specifies a scoring scale. This numerical scale is fixed for each objective. 

Each rubric can be associated with an objective. In return, a quiz optionally links to a rubric. A rubric can include objectives as criteria. An included objective does not need to be a part of the score.

If any, the rubric of an assignment or quiz does not have to relate to the scoring of the assessment.
