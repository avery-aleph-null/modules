# GitHub

GitHub is a online revision control repository (repo) service that has a user-friendly web interface. Everything in this module requires a registered account. If you already have a GitHub account, you can ignore the following steps.

1. Visit [https://github.com](https://github.com). Click `Sign up` in the upper right corner to register for an account.
2. You can use any email address. However, use the "w1234567@arc.losrios.edu" email to get some additional benefit that is free to educators.
3. Choose a password that is difficult to guess.
4. Think of a username.
5. Check your email for the launch code and enter it.
6. Sign in.
7. Answer a few questions. (More questions if you sign up as a teacher, you need to upload a picture of your ID.)

Everything starts with the Dashboard.

# Markdown

Markdown is technically a "markup" language, like HTML. However, unlike HTML, Markdown is visual even in plain text. Markdown is also much easier to type because it does not rely on HTML elements' open and close tags. Learn more about [how Markdown is used in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github).

Unfortunately, GitHub has multiple inconsistent ways to *render* Markdown in HTML for viewing. While the most basic method will work for most people, getting useful additional features to work while publishing MArkdown content using GitHub can be challenging.
