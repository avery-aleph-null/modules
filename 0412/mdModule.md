title: "Module 0412: Student-centric generative AI"
---

---

## What is generative AI?

* Artificial Intelligence tool that generates content:
  * Text
  * Images
  * Videos
  * Music

---

## AI may be a misnomer

* **Not** artificial:
  * Most AI tools are neural-net-based.
    * Machine learning from observing numerous human-created content
    * Humans also filter and select samples for training
    * A lot of human thumbs in this pie!
* **Not** intelligent:
  * Knowledgeable? Yes.
  * Intelligent? Not yet.
  * Limited critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
  * Very limited creative thinking and theorizing abilities.

---

## Examples

* ChatGPT
* Claude
* Gemini

---

## Student-centric objectives

* Get employed.
* Learn skills.
* Gain knowledge.
* Qualify for advancement.
* Transfer.

---

## Common ineffective ways of using G-AI

* Use AI in assessments intended to assess the students.
* "If AI can do your homework and take your tests, AI **will** take your job!"
* [Prompt engineering may be obsolete soon.](https://diginomica.com/prompt-engineer-hottest-new-job-almost-obsolete)

---

## Computer science as a case study

* In-demand: [employment growth of 23% from 2022 to 2032, considered a high growth.](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm)
* High recent graduate unemployment: [7.8%](https://www.synergisticit.com/tech-companies-not-hire-computer-science-graduates/)
* Why? (Hint: read the article linked in the previous point.)
* Will G-AI improve the situation or make it worse?

---

## Big question

* Are the SLOs applicable to G-AI or our students?
* If a student meets the SLOs but only with G-AI tools, is this student successful?
* *How* do we define student success?

---

## Learning versus assessment

* Use G-AI in the learning phase, not the assessment phase.

---

## G-AI explanation

* G-AI can help explain many concepts, but can it be relied upon?
  * If there is plenty of human-generated content that is correct, then the G-AI answer is more likely to be correct.
  * Does not work as well for concepts that do not have plenty of human-generated explanations.
* Can a student validate the G-AI explanation?
* Neural-net-based G-AI are probabilistic, there is *always* a chance of error.

---

## G-AI Q&A

* G-AI can generate questions for faculty and students.
* Is the answer (key) correct?
* Can a student validate the G-AI answer?

---

## A responsible way to use G-AI

* Instructor originates G-AI Q&A.
* Instructor validates and hides the answer.
* Students work on the question.
* The instructor discloses the answers and potentially evaluates the answers from each student.

---

## Practically no way to stop students from using G-AI

* Especially for fully online (and asynchronous) classes.
* Instructors need to point out and explain self-defeating ways of using G-AI.
* There are ways to "poison" prompting text, but it is defeatable.

---

## G-AI as a study tool

* Practical in some classes.
* ChatGPT accepts Markdown format as input.
* Input text from reading material, then interact as a way of studying.
* Is the result reliable?
* [An example, from the beginning.](https://chatgpt.com/share/288c9457-22f8-4972-820a-331f3f91e3e9).
 * Note how the prompt begins with "The following is some material that I want to understand. My questions will be in the following prompts."
 * The material source format is in Markdown, all the mathematical equations are captured correctly.
 * In this case, ChatGPT is correct in the subsequent interaction.
* Q&A prompt: "How is a P-type transistor different from an N-type transistor?"

---

## G-AI to generate a quick summary

* [An example, prompt: Can you summarize the source material as a bullet list that includes all the important definitions and notations?](https://chatgpt.com/share/288c9457-22f8-4972-820a-331f3f91e3e9).
* This can be helpful to a student who has already studied the material and attended the corresponding lecture. The summary is easier to study and refresh memory.
* This example is technically correct.

---

## G-AI as Q&A

* [An example of answering a question correctly, prompt: I think I understand the material now. Just to be sure, can you ask me a question, let me answer it, then evaluate my answer?](https://chatgpt.com/share/288c9457-22f8-4972-820a-331f3f91e3e9).
* [An example of answering a question incorrectly, prompt: Can you ask me another question?]
* [An example of asking for clarification in the explanation of an incorrect answer, prompt: Can you clarify that you mean by "The P-type transistors (Q1 and Q2) are turned on because they are controlled by a low voltage"? Specifically, what does a low-voltage at the gate of a P-type transistor do?](https://chatgpt.com/share/288c9457-22f8-4972-820a-331f3f91e3e9)

---

## G-AI for general study strategies

* [Study strategy that is specific to the context material: I still find this material difficult to understand, can you recommend a strategy that is specific to this material?](https://chatgpt.com/share/288c9457-22f8-4972-820a-331f3f91e3e9)
* Note how the response is specific to the context material.
* [Modeling effective note-taking in a specific context: If I were to take notes while reading this material, what would that note look like? Assume that I am fairly new to this material, but otherwise have a basic understanding of programming.](https://chatgpt.com/share/288c9457-22f8-4972-820a-331f3f91e3e9)
---

## G-AI can be a patient teaching assistant

* Perhaps one of the *best* application of G-AI that is productive for students!
* Need the licence of the source material to allow copy and paste as part of a prompt.
* The source material can be in any format, but Markdown is the best format.
* Shameless plug: check out Tak's OER workshop on 8/29!
