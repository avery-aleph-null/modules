## AI matches on!

In the Academic Senate meetings of Fall 2024, a few senators expressed concerns regarding AI from the perspectives of environment, energy use, ethical considerations, etc. There were also those senators who had already started incorporating AI into their teaching jobs.

Here is a quick update regarding recent AI developments.

* [ChatGPT o1 wants to win a chess game, so it cheated](https://bgr.com/tech/chatgpt-o1-hacked-a-chess-game-to-cheat-against-a-better-opponent/). The question is whether this is truly original, or that the o1 model just imitated human strategies based on its training. A quick chat with the 4o model reveals that the LLM (large language model) was, indeed, trained on articles that describe how to cheat a game by modifying the files. [Read this chat](https://chatgpt.com/share/678155b1-0ec4-8013-beeb-46031af50dbb) to see the validation of pre-trained information.
* [AI-assisted chip design surprised humans](https://scitechdaily.com/ais-strange-chip-designs-are-faster-smarter-and-game-changing/). This is an ongoing trend. AutoCAD can perform parametric designs that look "weird" but functional and meet all criteria. Note that this is usually a different kind of AI than the GPT type.
* [Unbound Academic experiments with school-without-teacher](https://www.zdnet.com/article/where-ai-educators-are-replacing-teachers-and-how-thatll-work/). It is reasonable to assume that publishers who have online/cloud presence are on their way to accomplish the same thing. Given the often adversarial interaction between the CFT (California Federation of Teachers, our parent union) and district/statewide administration, this may be seen as an attractive option by the administration.
* [Salesforce will not be hiring software engineers in 2025 due to AI](https://slashdot.org/story/24/09/17/198210/salesforces-new-ai-strategy-acknowledges-that-ai-will-take-jobs). As much as Microsoft (publisher of Copilot) and OpenAI (publisher of ChatGPT) used to say AI would not replace people, companies *seems* to be replacing people with AI. Whether this remains a concern for our students is unknown.

## Online classes

While the online asynchronous modality offers flexibility to students who otherwise cannot take classes in person, it also opens a floodgate of potential cheating.
